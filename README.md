# C-caster
A raycaster made with C and SDL3

⚠️ NO MAKEFILE INCLUDED SINCE I COULD NOT GET IT WORKING MYSELF <br>
You will have to set up your own environment on your IDE and OS, but the code is cross platform and will work if the dependencies are included
<br>
Dependencies-
<ul>
  <li>SDL3</li>
  <LI>GCC C compiler (or any C compiler)</LI>
</ul>

Future additions-
<ul>
  <li> Textures on walls </li>
  <li>Better movement when turning becuase there is acceleration right now</li>
  <li>More gui elements and perhaps a complete game one day</li>
</ul>
